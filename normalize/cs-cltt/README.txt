In an e-mail from 2017-02-19, Vincent wrote that he was planning to return to CLTT and fix errors before his dissertation D-day would come. So perhaps CLTT 2.0 is better (besides also adding a new annotation layer).
In an e-mail from 2016-05-12, Vincent mentioned their upcoming LREC (Portorož) poster about CLTT; the paper should mention also the UD conversion.
I do not remember whether I took the source directly from Lindat or it was a folder somewhere on the ÚFAL network.

CLTT 2.0 (released via LINDAT/CLARIN on 1.9.2017, not yet converted here):
http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-2498
* same text as CLTT 1.0 (although changes in tokenization and sentence segmentation may lead to slightly different statistics)
* fixed some annotation errors?
* new annotation layer: accounting entities
* new annotation layer: semantic entity relations

If we want to fix annotation errors, we should first switch to CLTT 2.0 and see if they were fixed by Vincent in the meantime!
Otherwise, here is a GitHub repository where the treebank was developed:
